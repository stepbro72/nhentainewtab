# Nhentai code opener

## Overview

This utility streamlines access to adult content from various sites, including Nhentai, sextb, and missav, by opening codes effortlessly. It enhances user convenience by adding a context menu item that, when a code is highlighted, opens it in a new tab. Notably, the newly opened tab remains unfocused to mitigate inconvenience when users wish to open multiple codes simultaneously.
